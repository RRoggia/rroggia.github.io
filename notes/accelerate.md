## Praise for accelerate

> Whether they recognize it or not, most organization today are in the business of software development in one way, shape, or form. And most are being dragged down by slow lead times, buggy output, and complicated features that add expense and frustrate users. It doesn't need to be this way.

## Foreword by Martin Fowler

> Their evidence refutes the bimodal IT notion that you have to choose between speed and stability - instead, speed depends on stability, so good IT practices gives you both.

## Preface

> improvements in software delivery are possible for every team and in every company, as long as leadership provides consistent support - including time, actions, and resources - demonstrating a true commitment to improvement, and as long as team members commit themselves to work.

> We also found that throughput and stability move together, and that an organization's ability to make software positively impacts profitability, productivity, and market share. We saw that culture and technical practices matter, ...

# Part One - What We Found

## Chapter 1 - Accelerate

> ... they are using small teams that work in short cycles and measure feedback from users to build products and services that delight their customers and rapidly deliver value to their organizations. These high performers are working incessantly to get better at what they do, letting no obstacles stand in their path, even in the face of high levels of risk and uncertainty about how they may achieve their goals.

> DevOps emerged from a small number of organizations facing a wicked problem: how to build secure, resilient, rapidly, evolving distributed systems at scale.

### Focus on capabilities, not maturity

> The key to successful change is measuring and understating the right things with a focus on capabilities - not on maturity.

> ... capabilities are multidimensional and dynamic, allowing different parts if the organization to take a customized approach to improvement, and focus on capabilities that will give them the most benefits.

> capabilities models focus on key outcomes and how the capabilities, or levers, drive improvements in those outcomes - that is, they are outcome based.

> Our own research and data have confirmed that the industry is changing: what is good enough and even "high performing" today is no longer good enough in the next year.

### The value of adopting DevOps

> - 46 times more frequent code deployments
> - 440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy
> - 170 times faster mean time to recover from downtime
> - 5 times lower change failure rate (1/5 as likely for a change to fail)

> High performers understand that they don't have to trade speed for stability or vice versa, because by building quality in they got both.

### My Summary

The initial assumption is that companies need to accelerate their businesses to remain competitive, otherwise, they will fail. In the attempt to transform and accelerate their businesses using software, these high performer companies reached a problem. How to build systems that are scalable, reliable, stable, secure, ..., while maintaining their agility. That's the beginning of the DevOps movement.

Even though there are companies exceeding with DevOps, this is not a true for the whole market. And even for the companies that are part of the movement, there is a disconnection between the leadership and the DevOps practitioners. Meaning the potential for value delivery and business acceleration might be greater than expected.

How to measure the maturity of DevOps?

Four reasons not to use maturity model:

1. Once on mature state, declare the journey done
2. Maturity level is not the same across teams and organizations
3. Maturity model do not measure the outcome. It usually only measures the technical profit.
4. Maturity model do not consider the ever changing nature of IT.

Use capability model:

1. Endless journey. Continually improving and progressing technology and business.
2. Customized approach enabling to focus on key capabilities to achieve the most benefit.
3. Outcome based.
4. Focus on the right capabilities. Never settling for yesterday's accomplishment.

*Which* capabilities to focus varies. But, it's not because of age and technology, because or developers or operations doing deployments.

It's astonishingly to see the gap between high performers that are applying devops with those that aren't. It was never about stability or speed. By adding quality in the process you achieve both.
