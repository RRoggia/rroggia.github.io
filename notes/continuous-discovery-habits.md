# Foreword

> They want to improve. They know they need to improve. They usually understand the theory of how strong teams work. But they just don’t have the hands-on experience and knowledge to be able to provide the coaching their people need.

# Part I What is Continuous Discovery

## Chapter One The What and Why of Continuous Discovery

> I’ll refer to the work that you do to decide what to build as discovery and the work that you do to build and ship a product as delivery

> they focus on whether you shipped what you said you would on time and on budget—while under-investing in discovery, forgetting to assess if you built the right stuff.

> In the early days of software, business leaders owned discovery—they decided what to build. Discovery happened once a year in an annual budgeting process, where projects with fixed timelines were assigned to specific engineering teams.

> The authors of the Agile manifesto advocated for shorter cycles with more frequent customer feedback. Second, they proposed working at a pace that could be sustained continuously, rather than furiously scurrying from one milestone to another. Third, they advocated for maximum flexibility—having the ability to adapt to customer feedback quickly and easily. And fourth, they advocated for simplicity.

> Leaders struggled to give up ownership of discovery. Even with shorter cycles and more customer feedback, business stakeholders still clung to their original ideas. Most teams weren’t very good at estimating unpredictable work (who is?), and their shorter cycles, aptly named sprints in Scrum, truly became biweekly sprints, killing any chance of finding a continuously sustainable pace. The rest of the business continued operating on an annual budgeting cycle, making true flexibility nearly impossible. When teams learned something wouldn’t work, they were still expected to deliver it on time and under budget. Usability testing was often done too late in the process, making it hard to address the substantial issues that were so often uncovered. User research was often outsourced to design agencies who did project-based research. And finally, teams continued to be measured by what they delivered, not whether anyone used it or if it created any value for the customer or the business.

> Throughout the book, the term “product trio” will refer to a product manager, a designer, and a software engineer working together to develop products for their customers.

> Each team needs to define the right “trio” on their team to adopt these habits.

> That means rather than defining your success by the code that you ship (your output), you define success as the value that code creates for your customers and for your business (the outcomes).

> We elevate customer needs to be on par with business needs and focus on creating customer value as well as business value.

> Rather than the product manager decides, the designer designs, and the engineer codes, we embrace a model where we make team decisions while leveraging the expertise and knowledge that we each bring to those decisions.

> The habits in this book will encourage you to draw, to externalize your thinking, and to map what you know.

> to do discovery well, we need to learn to think like scientists identifying assumptions and gathering evidence.

### My Summary

This first chapter introduces talks about the evolution of product / software development over time. Starting with a more project driven, based on the decisions of few, then going through the agile movement and companies trying to adapt but failing to change the way they work. And at last, with the evolution of product instrumentation companies finding the right spot and culture to achieve better results.

The "product trio" is composed by a product manager, a designer and a software engineer. This is not a static structure each company needs to find the right fit for their product trio. 

There are companies failing to achieve the expected results, because they try to copy a framework or methodology without understanding the the whys behind the practices. It's required to cultivate 6 mindsets in order to achieve the continuous delivery:

1. outcome-oriented
2. customer-centric
3. collaborative
4. visual
5. experimental
6. continuous

At last the author differentiates companies who sporadically uses modern discovery practices to companies who have achieve a continuous discovery, then it proposes the following definition:

> At a minimum, weekly touchpoints with customers
>
> By the team building the product
>
> Where they conduct small research activities
>
> In pursuit of a desired outcome

## Chapter Two A Common Framework for Continuous Discovery

> The company rightly started with a desired outcome: To increase the average number of accounts per customer. However, they didn’t pair this outcome mindset with a customer-centric mindset, that is critical for long-term product success.

> by arguing that serving customers is how we generate profit.

> Rather than obsessing about features (outputs), we are shifting our focus to the impact those features have on both our customers and our business (outcomes).

> When a product trio is tasked with delivering an outcome, the business is clearly communicating what value the team can create for the business. And when the business leaves it up to the team to explore the best outputs that might drive that outcome, they are giving the team the latitude they need to create value for the customer.

> So, when we shift from an output mindset to an outcome mindset, we have to relearn how to do our jobs.

> Ill-structured problems are defined by having many solutions. There are no right or wrong answers, only better or worse ones.

> I’ll refer to customer needs, pain points, and desires collectively as “opportunities”—they represent opportunities to intervene in our customers’ lives in a positive way.

> To reach their desired outcome, a product trio must discover and explore the opportunity space. The opportunity space, however, is infinite.

> two of the most important steps for reaching our desired outcome are first, how we map out and structure the opportunity space, and second, how we select which opportunities to pursue.

> We do have to get to solutions—shipping code is how we ship value to our customers and create value for our business. But the right problem framing will help to ensure that we explore and ultimately ship better solutions.

> It starts with defining a clear outcome—one that sets the scope for discovery. From there, we must discover and map out the opportunity space—this is what gives structure to the ill-structured problem of reaching our desired outcome. It’s the all-important problem framing that opens up the solution space. And finally, we need to discover the solutions that will address those opportunities and thus drive our desired outcome.

> opportunity solution tree (OST).

> You start by prioritizing your business need—creating value for your business is what ensures that your team can serve your customer over time.

### My Summary

Opportunity solution tree:

- Resolve the tension between business needs and customer needs
- Build and maintain a shared understanding of how they might reach their desired outcome
- Adopt a continuous mindset
- Unlock better decision-making
- Unlock faster learning cycles
- Build confidence in knowing what to do next
- Unlock simpler stakeholder management
