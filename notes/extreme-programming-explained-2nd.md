# Praise for *Extreme Programming Explained, Second Edition*

> My only beef is that our profession has gotten to a point where such common-sense ideas are labeled 'extreme'...

> Do not be frightened by the name, it is not that extreme at all. It is mostly good old recipes ad common sense, nicely integrated together, getting rid of all the fat that has accumulated over the years.

# The XP Series

> (XP) is a discipline of the business of software development that focuses the whole team on common, reachable goals.

> XP practices are chosen for their encouragement f human creativity and their acceptance of human frailty.

> XP teams produce quality software at a sustainable pace.

> XP aims to achieve these goals by celebrating and serving the human needs of everyone touched by software development sponsors, managers, testers, users, and programmers.

# Foreword to the First Edition

> Delivering software is hard, and delivering quality software in time is even harder. To make it work requires the disciplined use of additional best practices.

# Preface

> The goal of Extreme Programming (XP) is outstanding software development.

> Software can be developed at lower cost, with fewer defects, with higher productivity, and with much higher return on investment.

# Chapter 1. What is XP?

> Extreme Programming (XP) is about social change.

> It is about letting go of habits an patterns that were adaptive in the past, but now get in the way of us doing our best work.

> It is about being open about what we are capable of doing and then doing it.

> You need both technique and good relationships to be successful. XP addresses both.

> XP is a style of software development focusing on excellent application of programming techniques, clear communication and teamwork.

> XP includes:
>
> - A philosophy of software development based on the values of communication, feedback, simplicity, courage and respect.
> - A body of practices proven useful in improving software development. The practices complement each other, amplifying their effects. They are chosen as expressions of the values.
> - A set of complementary principles, intellectual techniques for translating the values into practice, useful when there isn't a practice handy for your particular problem.
> - A community that shares these values and many of the same practices

> It is  distinguished from other methodologies by:
>
> - Its short development cycles, resulting in early, concrete and continuing feedback.
> - Its incremental planning approach, which quickly comes up with an overall plan that is expected to evolve through the life of the project.
> - Its ability to flexibly schedule the implementation of functionality, responding to changing business needs.
> - Its reliance on automated tests written by programmers, customers, and testers to monitor the progress of development, to allow the system to evolve, and to catch defects early.
> - Its reliance on oral communication, tests, and source code to communicate system structure and intent.
> - Its reliance on an evolutionary design process that last as as long as the system lasts.
> - Its reliance on the close collaboration of actively engaged individuals with ordinary talent.
> - Its reliance on practices that work with both the short-term instincts of the team members an the long-term interests of the project.

> XP can be described this way:
>
> - XP is lightweight. In XP you only do what you need to do to create value for the customers.
> - XP is a methodology based on addressing constraints in software development. ... Methodology is often interpreted to mean "a set of rules to follow that guarantee success." Methodologies don't work like programs. People aren't computers. Every team dos XP differently with varying degrees of success.
> - The values and principles behind XP are applicable at any scale.
> - XP adapts to vague or rapidly changing requirements.

> XP is my attempt to reconcile humanity and productivity in my own practice of software development and to share that reconciliation.

> The pursuit of excellence in technique is critical in a social style of development.

> If you can accurately estimate your work, deliver quality the first time, and create rapid feedback loops; then you can be a trustworthy partner.

> XP teams play full out to win and accept responsibility for the consequences.

> but it is always best to act as if there is going to be enough.

> You can do your best work even when there are constraints. Fussing about the constraints distracts you from your goal. Your clean self does the best work no matter what the constraints are.

> It's not my job to "manage" someone else's expectations. It's their job to manage their own expectations. It's my job to do my best and to communicate clearly.

> How does XP address the risks in the development process?
>
> - Schedule slips XP calls for short release cycles, a few months at most, so the scope of any slip is limited. Within a release, XP uses one-week iterations of customer-requested features to create fine-grained feedback about progress. Within an iteration, XP plans with short tasks, so the team can solve problems during the cycle. Finally, XP calls for implementing the highest priority features first, so any features that slip past the release will be of lower value.
> - XP always keeps the system in deployable condition.
> - Defect Rate XP tests from the perspective of both programmers writing tests function-by-function and customers writing tests program-feature-by-program-feature.
> - XP calls for business-oriented people to be first-class members of the team.
> - XP shortens the release cycle, so there is less change during the development of a single release.
> - XP insists that only the highest priority tasks are addressed.
> - Staff turnover XP asks programmers to accept responsibility for estimating and completing their own work, gives them feedback about the actual time taken so their estimates can improve, and respects those estimates. The rules for who can make and change estimates are clear. Thus, there is less chance for a programmer to get frustrated by being asked to do the obviously impossible... New team members are  encouraged to gradually accept more and more responsibility, and are assisted along the way by each other and by existing programmers.

> XP assumes that you see yourself as part of a team, ideally one with clear goals and a plan of execution. XP assumes that you want to work together. XP assumes that change can be made inexpensive using this method. XP assumes that you want to grow, to improve your skills, and to improve your relationships. XP assumes you are willing to make changes to meet those goals.

> What is XP?
>
> - XP is giving up old, ineffective technical and social habits in favor of new ones that work.
> - XP is fully appreciating yourself for total effort today.
> - XP is striving to do better tomorrow.
> - XP is evaluating yourself by your contribution to the team's shared goals.
> - XP is asking to get some of your human needs met through software development.

## My Summary

The XP is presented as a change of the practices applied in software engineering at the time of the book's publication. It proposes not only technical but also relationships lead to good businesses. 

XP includes values, principles, practices and a community.

It's distinguished by waterfall methodologies due to its short cycles, incremental planning, responding to business changes, automated tests, evolutionary systems and close collaboration. To say only a few.

XP is lightweight and focused to do the simplest that delivers value to customers. It's a methodology that addresses constraints in software development. It's not a recipe, rather each team will apply XP differently with varying degrees of success. XP can be applied at any scale due to its values and principles. Even though XP works in situations where requirements don't change it shines in contexts with rapidly changing requirements.

It tries to boost productivity by recognizing the importance of humanity. Of course, the pursuit of technical excellence is critical in a *social style of development*. It proposes that if you can apply techniques that will accurately estimate work, deliver software with quality and create rapid feedback loops, and ultimately business value you'll be considered a trustworthy partner.

When applying XP you apply 100% of what you got, you act to achieve your best and you are able to achieve your best even when there are constraints.

XP addresses risk at all levels of software development:

- XP proposes release cycles ( a few months at most) to reduce time to market and get feedback earlier. Within a release the every week the team gets feedback about their progress. Short release cycles also reduce the changes during development and increase the flexibility for business changes.
- XP teams also prioritize work and focus on the highest value.
- The business is considered first-class member of the development to seek for the highest value delivers and help to refine the business.
- XP focus on quality to reduce defect rate and in automation to ensure the system is always in a ready to deploy state.
- XP teams are responsible for doing the estimate and for completing their work. This reduces frustration from missed impossible deadlines assigned top down to developers. Also, it's expected that a new team member will gradually accept more and more responsibilities.

XP assumes that you believe at teamwork, that changes shouldn't be expensive, that you are seeking technical excellence and to improve your relationships. You'll have to change to achieve this goals.

# Section 1: Exploring XP

# Chapter 2. Learning to Drive

> "...Driving is about constantly paying attention, making a little correction this way, a little correction that way".

> This is the paradigm for XP. Stay aware. Adapt. Change.

> Everything in software changes. The requirements change. The design changes. The business changes. the technology changes. The team changes. The team members change. The problem isn't change, because change is going to happen; the problem rather, is our inability to cope with change.

> Customer dive the content of the system. The whole team drives the development process. XP lets you adapt by making frequent, small corrections; moving towards your goal with deployed software at short intervals. You don't wait a long time to find out if you were going the wrong way.

> Customers (internal or external) start with a general idea of what problems the system need to solve.

> The customers on the team need to keep in mind where on the horizon they want to go even as they decide, week-by-week, where the software should go *next*.

> As development continues, the team becomes aware of which of their practices enhance and which of their practices detract from their goals.

## My Summary

Change will occur no matter what. We have to be ready to work with it. The author uses driving as an analogy for XP and changes. Stay aware. Adapt. Change.

This analogy works in two different levels:

- Customer: You start with an idea of what you want to build, and you adapt and apply small corrections in order to come closer to your goal.
- Development: Similarly for development, you start with a set of practices, and as the project evolves you improve these practices by understanding what you have to enhance in these practices.

# Chapter 3. Values, Principles and Practices

> Practices are the things you do day-to-day. Specifying practices is useful because they are clear and objective. You either write a test before you change code or you don't.

> Call this level of knowledge and understanding values. Values are the roots of the things we like and don't like in a situation.

> Making values explicit is important because without values, practices quickly become rote, activities performed for their own sake but lacking any purpose or direction.

> The defect itself might be a failure of technique, but the reluctance to learn from the defect shows that the programmer doesn't actually value learning and elf-improvement as much as something else.

> Values bring purpose to practices.

> Just as values bring purpose to practices, practices bring accountability to values.

> Principles are domain-specific guidelines for life.

> It is a start but it isn't enough for you to master XP.

## My Summary

Third chapter starts with an analogy about learning the basics about a skill and being a gardening master.

Level of understanding:

- Practice: Clear and objective. Either you do or you don't. A place to start. Value's accountability.
- Principles: The bridge between practice and value. It's domain specific.
- Values: The roots of the things we like and don't like in a situation. A highly developed sense of good and bad. Experience. Practice's purpose.

You are not an extreme programmer master because you read a book.
