You can easily create a virtual infrastructure to run your workloads with EC2.</p>\n<h3>Instance type</h3>\n<p>In EC2 you spin up <strong>instances</strong> (virtual computing environments) based on a <strong>instance type</strong>. The <strong>instance type</strong> is the hardware configuration that determines CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. The instance types can be categorized depending on the workload they best suit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General Purpose: A balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, and can be used for a wide range of workloads</li>\n<li>Compute Optimized: High-performance processors</li>\n<li>Memory Optimized: Workloads that process large data sets in memory</li>\n<li>Accelerated Computing: Uses hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform some functions, such as floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs</li>\n<li>Storage Optimized: High, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each category has <strong>families</strong>, a group of instance types within a family that have common workloads. A category can have several families each supporting a different workload.</p>\n<p>Each family contains the <strong>generations</strong> of a instance type. Each new generation improves the existing and has slightly variations on the instance type. </p>\n<p>An instance also has a <strong>size</strong> which vary accordingly with the family and generation. Some examples are <em>nano</em>, <em>medium</em> and <em>xlarge</em>.</p>\n<p>You read the instance type from left to right. For example the instance type <em>c5n.xlarge</em> reads as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instance family: c - Compute Optimized</li>\n<li>Instance generation: 5</li>\n<li>Attribute: n - Network optimization</li>\n<li>Instance size: xlarge</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"EC2 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud"},"isFile":true,"fileName":"elastic-compute-cloud"}],"folders":[]}},
