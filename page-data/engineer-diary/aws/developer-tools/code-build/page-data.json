It provides compute resources to compile, run unit tests and  to produce your artifacts. This service runs for an AWS Region.</p>\n<h2>Core Concepts</h2>\n<p>You start creating a <strong>Build Project</strong>, in it you specify which and where is the <strong>Source code</strong> . Currently it supports S3, CodeCommit, GitHub (public and enterprise) and BitBucket. Each source has to specify one branch.</p>\n<p>The Build project has an <strong>Environment</strong>, it determines the base image and the IAM Service Role that is going to be used. An environment can also have <strong>Environment Variables</strong> that can be consumed during the build, certificates, compute type specification and VPC connectivity configuration.</p>\n<p>The build logs can be configured to use both CloudWatch and S3.</p>\n<p>A build's <strong>Artifact</strong> can be published to a S3 Bucket.</p>\n<p>You can generate Notification based on the Build State Events (Failed, Succeeded,...) this can send notifications to a SNS Topic, Slack or Microsoft Teams.</p>\n<p>A <code>buildspec</code> file needs to be provided by the source or in the Build Project. It specifies the commands to be executed during the build phases. There are 4 phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>install</code>: Installing packages in the build environment</li>\n<li><code>pre_build</code>: Install build dependencies</li>\n<li><code>build</code>: Run the build steps</li>\n<li><code>post_build</code>: Generate or publish artifacts generated in build phase</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>buildspec</code> file can also specify environment variables or retrieve values from the Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.</p>\n<p>Everytime you run the build project, it generates a log in the <strong>Build History</strong>. You can start the build manually, create <strong>Build Triggers</strong> to run with a frequency or integrate with CodePipeline.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Code Build"},"isFile":true,"fileName":"code-build"}},
