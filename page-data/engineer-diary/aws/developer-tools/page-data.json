It provides compute resources to compile, run unit tests and  to produce your artifacts. This service runs for an AWS Region.</p>\n<h2>Core Concepts</h2>\n<p>You start creating a <strong>Build Project</strong>, in it you specify which and where is the <strong>Source code</strong> . Currently it supports S3, CodeCommit, GitHub (public and enterprise) and BitBucket. Each source has to specify one branch.</p>\n<p>The Build project has an <strong>Environment</strong>, it determines the base image and the IAM Service Role that is going to be used. An environment can also have <strong>Environment Variables</strong> that can be consumed during the build, certificates, compute type specification and VPC connectivity configuration.</p>\n<p>The build logs can be configured to use both CloudWatch and S3.</p>\n<p>A build's <strong>Artifact</strong> can be published to a S3 Bucket.</p>\n<p>You can generate Notification based on the Build State Events (Failed, Succeeded,...) this can send notifications to a SNS Topic, Slack or Microsoft Teams.</p>\n<p>A <code>buildspec</code> file needs to be provided by the source or in the Build Project. It specifies the commands to be executed during the build phases. There are 4 phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>install</code>: Installing packages in the build environment</li>\n<li><code>pre_build</code>: Install build dependencies</li>\n<li><code>build</code>: Run the build steps</li>\n<li><code>post_build</code>: Generate or publish artifacts generated in build phase</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>buildspec</code> file can also specify environment variables or retrieve values from the Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.</p>\n<p>Everytime you run the build project, it generates a log in the <strong>Build History</strong>. You can start the build manually, create <strong>Build Triggers</strong> to run with a frequency or integrate with CodePipeline.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Code Build"},"isFile":true,"fileName":"code-build"},{"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/rroggia.github.io/rroggia.github.io/engineer-diary/AWS/developer-tools/code-commit.md","html":"<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/index.html\">Documentation</a></p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Code Commit is a version control system (VCS) service  that enables you to store and manage Git repositories in your AWS Account. This service runs for an AWS Region.</p>\n<p>It offers similiar functionalities like the most known VCS products like GitHub.</p>\n<h2>Core Concepts</h2>\n<p>The <strong>repository</strong>, represents a git repository, is its base unit. For the developers to clone the repository locally they need to setup either the SSH or HTTPS security credentials in the IAM serivce. The user authorization is also managed by the IAM.</p>\n<p>You can create <strong>Approval rule</strong> templates for pull request (PR) and assign it to repositories, you can define a <strong>minimum number of approvals</strong> and a <strong>pool of approval members</strong>, which only their approval are count for the minimum number of approvals. These rules can be applied only for PRs of a specific destination branch.</p>\n<p>Code Commit can send notifications based on events (PR created, comments on PR, ...) to SNS topics, slack or microsoft teams.</p>\n<p>Code Commit also offers the possibility to trigger either a SNS Topic or a Lambda Function everytime an Event is triggered </p>\n<p>It also integrates with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer which sends recommendations on how to improve your code in the PRs.</p>\n<p>Besides it also offers the common functionality expected like creating PR, managing branches, navigating through the code,...</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Code Commit"},"isFile":true,"fileName":"code-commit"},{"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/rroggia.github.io/rroggia.github.io/engineer-diary/AWS/developer-tools/code-pipeline.md","html":"<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/index.html\">Documentation</a></p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service. It's used together with Code Commit, Code Build and Code Deploy to automate the release of your software. This service runs for an AWS Region.</p>\n<h2>Core Concepts</h2>\n<p>CodePipeline has the base unit as the <strong>Pipeline</strong>. When you create it, you specify its name, and assign an IAM Role that is going to be assumed during the execution. In addition, you can choose a S3 Bucket to store the Pipeline's Artifact as well as an encryption key (either AWS Managed Key or a Customer Managed key).</p>\n<p>A Pipeline has a <strong>Source stage</strong>, which integrates with CodeCommit, ECR, S3 or market VCS. When using CodeCommit as its source you can choose how to detect the changes in the source (CloudWatch Events or CodePipeline periodic pulls).</p>\n<p>A Pipeline can have a <strong>Build stage</strong>, which integrates with CodeBuild or Jenkins. In the build step you can also configure environment variables (Plain Text, Parameter Store or SSM).</p>\n<p>A Pipeline can also have a <strong>Deploy stage</strong>, which integrates with CodeDeploy.</p>\n<p>A Pipeline must have at least two Stages. The source stage is required, but you can choose with build, deploy or both.</p>\n<p>The Pipeline execution is trigerred automatically based on the source configuration, through the <strong>Pipeline History</strong> you can list the pipeline's executions. Each pipeline's execution shows details about the actions executed (stages) and their state.</p>\n<p>Similar to the other AWS Services you can configure notifications based on Events to SNS Topics, Slack or Microsoft teams.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Code Pipeline"},"isFile":true,"fileName":"code-pipeline"}],"folders":[]}},
