A Resource has a <strong>Path</strong> and its possible to attach documentation to it. A resource can have multiple <strong>Methods</strong>, each method defines one possible interface used to access that resource. Each method specifies one of the HTTP Verb (GET, POST, ...) as a <strong>Method Type</strong>.</p>\n<p>A method has two components a <strong>Method Request</strong> and a <strong>Method Response</strong>. The Method Request defines the resource's interface by specifying the required or expected <strong>URL Query String Parameters</strong>, <strong>Request Headers</strong> and <strong>Request Body</strong>. You can also add a <strong>Authorization</strong> or configure the method to require an API key, in addition you can configure a <strong>Request Validator</strong>, which can validate query, headers and body.</p>\n<p>The method also contains information about the <strong>Integration</strong> between the Method and a backend service, which can be AWS services, services running within or outside AWS or even a Mock. Similar to the Method an integration is also composed by a Request and a Response.</p>\n<p>When the API Gateway receives an HTTP requesting a resource, it follows the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Method Request</li>\n<li>Integration Request</li>\n<li>Integration Response</li>\n<li>Method Response</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When using <strong>Mock Integration</strong> configure both the <strong>Integration Request</strong> with a <strong>Template Model</strong> containing a status code and the <strong>Integration Response</strong> with the mock data.</p>\n<p>When using the <strong>AWS_PROXY</strong> Integration you can configure the API Gateway to send the an event object to the service being requested. The AWS service can then use this data to process and return a response. Using this integration API Gateway might require permissions to access the AWS Service they are trying to reach.</p>\n<p>It's also possible to setup an <strong>HTTP_PROXY</strong> integration, in which you configure the service URL and ports, this is useful for services running outside AWS. When API Gateway receives requests it sends the Integration request as configured and waits it response to send it back to the API Gateway's client.</p>\n<p>API Gateway also supports <strong>AWS</strong> and <strong>HTTP</strong> integrations. Both can be used when you want to do more than only proxying the requests, for example, providing data transformation.</p>\n<p>In order to make the API available for the end users you have to create a <strong>Deployment</strong>, which acts like a point in time for all your resources. The Deployments is made to a <strong>Stage</strong> which could act as an environment, you can have several Stages and each stage can contain several deployments. In a Stage you can configure which is the active deployment, and configure deployment strategies for new deployments. Other functionalities like Cache, Logging and tracing are also available per Stage.</p>\n<h1>Todo</h1>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<p><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Rest API</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Endpoint:</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Public and private Rest APIs regional, edge?</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> default is edge</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Usage plans</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> API Keys</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> HTTP API</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> WebSocket API</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"API Gateway"},"isFile":true,"fileName":"api-gateway"}},
