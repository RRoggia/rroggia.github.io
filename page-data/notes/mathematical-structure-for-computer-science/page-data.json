If no approach presents itself, let it be and think about it again later. Repeat this process for days on end. When you finally wake up in the middle of the night with an idea, you’ll know you are putting in the right amount of effort for this course.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>1 - Formal Logic</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/images/concept.png\" alt=\"new concept\"> A <strong>statement</strong> (or <strong>proposition</strong>) is a sentence that is either true or false.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...A, B, and C, are used to represent statements and are called statement letters;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the symbol <code>^</code> is a logical connective representing <em>and</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/images/concept.png\" alt=\"new concept\"> The expression <code>A ^ B</code> is called the <strong>conjunction</strong> of A and B, and A and B are called the <strong>conjuncts</strong> of this expression</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another connective is the word <em>or</em>, denoted by the symbol <code>V</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/images/concept.png\" alt=\"new concept\"> The expression <code>A V B</code> (read “A or B”) is called the <strong>disjunction</strong> of A and B, and A and B are called the <strong>disjuncts</strong> of this expression</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/images/concept.png\" alt=\"new concept\"> The logical connective here is <strong>implication</strong>, and it conveys the meaning that the truth of A implies or leads to the truth of B.
