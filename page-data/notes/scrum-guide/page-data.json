Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Transparency</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Those performing the work and those inspecting the resulting increment must share a common definition of “Done”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Inspection</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Adaptation</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>four formal events for inspection and adaptation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sprint Planning</li>\n<li>Daily Scrum</li>\n<li>Sprint Review</li>\n<li>Sprint Retrospective</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Scrum Values</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>values of commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commitment</strong>: People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.\n<strong>Courage</strong>: The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.\n<strong>Focus</strong>: Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team.\n<strong>Openness</strong>: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work.\n<strong>Respect</strong>: Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>The Scrum Team</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Incremental deliveries of “Done” product ensure a potentially useful version of working product is always available.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Product Owner</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;</li>\n<li>Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;</li>\n<li>Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs; </li>\n<li>Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; </li>\n<li>Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the Product Owner remains accountable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item’s priority must address the Product Owner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The development team</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A “Done” increment is required at the Sprint Review. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Development Teams have the following characteristics: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;</li>\n<li>Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment;</li>\n<li>Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being performed by the person;</li>\n<li>Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of domains that need to be addressed like testing, architecture, operations, or business analysis;</li>\n<li>Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Scrum Master</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensuring that goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the Scrum Team as well as possible;</li>\n<li>Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;</li>\n<li>Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;</li>\n<li>Understanding product planning in an empirical environment; </li>\n<li>Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value;</li>\n<li>Understanding and practicing agility;</li>\n<li>Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Scrum Master Service to the Development Team</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Scrum Master serves the Development Team in several ways, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality;</li>\n<li>Helping the Development Team to create high-value products; </li>\n<li>Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress; </li>\n<li>Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed;</li>\n<li>Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Scrum Master Service to the Organization</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption; </li>\n<li>Planning Scrum implementations within the organization;</li>\n<li>Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development;</li>\n<li>Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team;</li>\n<li>Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Scrum Events</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum duration.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Sprint</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;</li>\n<li>Quality goals do not decrease;</li>\n<li>Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each Sprint has a goal of what is to be built</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal at least every calendar month.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sprints also limit risk to one calendar month of cost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Cancelling a Sprint</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sprint cancellations are often traumatic to the Scrum Team, and are very uncommon</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Sprint Planning</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?</li>\n<li>How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Topic one: What can be done this Sprint?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, projected capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint, and past performance of the Development Team</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog, and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Topic Two: How will the chosen work get done?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items for the Sprint, the Development Team decides how it will build this functionality into a “Done” product Increment during the Sprint.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p> The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Development Team usually starts by designing the system and the work needed to convert the Product Backlog into a working product Increment. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, enough work is planned during Sprint Planning for the Development Team to forecast what it believes it can do in the upcoming Sprint. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Sprint Goal</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal can be any other coherence that causes the Development Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Daily Scrum</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</li>\n<li>What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</li>\n<li>Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Daily Scrum is an internal meeting for the Development Team. If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures that they do not disrupt the meeting</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Daily Scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify impediments to development for removal, highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve the Development Team’s level of knowledge. This is a key inspect and adapt meeting</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Sprint Review</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p> A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sprint Review includes the following elements: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner;</li>\n<li>The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been “Done” and what has not been “Done”;</li>\n<li>The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved;</li>\n<li>The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment;</li>\n<li>The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely target and delivery dates based on progress to date (if needed);</li>\n<li>The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning;</li>\n<li>Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next; </li>\n<li>Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated releases of functionality or capability of the product.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Sprint Retrospectives</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;</li>\n<li>Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements;</li>\n<li>Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is the adaptation to the inspection of the Scrum Team itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Scrum artifacts</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Product Backlog</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful. If a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Requirements never stop changing, so a Product Backlog is a living artifact. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>More precise estimates are made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower the order, the less detail</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Product Backlog items that can be “Done” by the Development Team within one Sprint are deemed “Ready” for selection in a Sprint Planning</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping it understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Monitoring Progress Toward Goals</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision-making.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Sprint Backlog</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To ensure continuous improvement, it includes at least one high priority process improvement identified in the previous Retrospective meeting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Daily Scrum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the Development Team.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Monitoring Sprint Progress</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog can be summed</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Increment</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be “Done,” which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of “Done.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p> The increment is a step toward a vision or goal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Artifact Transparency</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Decisions to optimize value and control risk are made based on the perceived state of the artifacts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Scrum Master’s job is to work with the Scrum Team and the organization to increase the transparency of the artifacts. This work usually involves learning, convincing, and change. Transparency doesn’t occur overnight, but is a path.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Definition of \"Done\"</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as “Done”, everyone must understand what “Done” means. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Development Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint. This Increment is useable, so a Product Owner may choose to immediately release it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the definition of \"Done\" for an increment is part of the conventions, standards or guidelines of the development organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If \"Done\" for an increment is not a convention of the development organization, the Development Team of the Scrum Team must define a definition of “Done” appropriate for the product.</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Scrum guide"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2095566405","2252066150","425755332"]}
