Nothing here tells us how to solve problems universally, but that is the point. Stories like these are far more valuable than the code or designs they resulted in. Implementations are ephemeral, but the documented reasoning is priceless. Rarely do we have access to this kind of insight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Preface</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We apply the principles of computer science and engineering to the design and development of computing systems: generally, large distributed ones. Sometimes, our task is writing the software for those systems alongside our product development counterparts; sometimes, our task is building all the additional pieces those systems need, like backups or load balancing, ideally so they can be reused across systems; and sometimes, our task is figuring out how to apply existing solutions to new problems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a system isn’t very useful if nobody can use it! Because reliability is so critical, SREs are focused on finding ways to improve the design and operation of systems to make them more scalable, more reliable, and more efficient.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p> it’s still worth putting lightweight reliability support in place early on, because it’s less costly to expand a structure later on than it is to introduce one that is not present.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Part I - Introduction</h1>\n<h2>Chapter 1 - Introduction</h2>"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Site Reliability Engineering"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1507822185","2095566405","2894216461","425755332"]}
