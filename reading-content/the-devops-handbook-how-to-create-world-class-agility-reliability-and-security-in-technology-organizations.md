# Foreword

>  success in modern technical endeavors absolutely requires multiple perspectives and expertise to collaborate.

# Imagine a World Where Dev and Ops Become DevOps

> Imagine a world where product owners, Development, QA, IT Operations, and Infosec work together, not only to help each other, but also to ensure that the overall organization succeeds. By working toward a common goal, they enable the fast flow of planned work into production (e.g., performing tens, hundreds, or even thousands of code deploys per day), while achieving world-class stability, reliability, availability, and security.

> In almost every IT organization, there is an inherent conflict between Development and IT Operations which creates a downward spiral, resulting in ever-slower time to market for new products and features, reduced quality, increased outages, and, worst of all, an ever-increasing amount of technical debt.

## My Summary

There is a world where we don't have to fight our whole organization to deliver value for your organization. A world where skillful people work together toward a common goal. This is DevOps.
